# Home Lab Setup with Proxmox for HA Ceph Cluster on an HA Kubernetes Cluster


In this setup guide, we will walk through the process of creating a comprehensive home lab environment using Proxmox. Our goal is to configure a High Availability (HA) Ceph Cluster, an HA Kubernetes Cluster, along with additional configurations for an NGINX Load Balancer, Grafana Server, and NTP Server.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure that you have the following prerequisites in place:

Hardware: A dedicated server or multiple servers with sufficient resources to run virtual machines and containers.
 -- Proxmox: Install and configure Proxmox Virtual Environment on each server.
 -- Networking: Setup a reliable network infrastructure with proper IP addressing and connectivity between servers.

### Steps

1. Setting up High Availability Ceph Cluster
Install Ceph: Deploy Ceph on the Proxmox cluster nodes. Configure OSDs, MONs, and MGRs to create a robust Ceph storage solution.

  -- Monitor and Manage: Utilize the Ceph Dashboard to monitor and manage the health and performance of the Ceph cluster.

2. Configuring High Availability Kubernetes Cluster
Install Kubernetes: Use Proxmox VMs to create a multi-node Kubernetes cluster. Deploy kubeadm, kubelet, and kubectl on each node.

  -- HA Setup: Implement high availability components such as etcd clustering and multiple control plane nodes for resilience.

3. NGINX Load Balancer Configuration
Install NGINX: Create a Proxmox VM to run NGINX. Configure it as a reverse proxy and load balancer to distribute traffic to Kubernetes services.

4. Setting up Grafana Server
Deploy Grafana: Create a Proxmox VM for Grafana. Install and configure Grafana to visualize and monitor various metrics from your Kubernetes cluster and Ceph storage.

5. NTP Server Configuration
Setup NTP Server: Deploy a Proxmox VM dedicated to running an NTP server. Synchronize time across all cluster nodes to ensure consistency.


# Conclusion
By following these steps, you'll have successfully set up a comprehensive home lab environment using Proxmox. This setup includes a High Availability Ceph Cluster, a High Availability Kubernetes Cluster, an NGINX Load Balancer, a Grafana Server for monitoring, and an NTP Server for time synchronization. This lab will serve as a valuable platform for testing, learning, and experimenting with various technologies in a controlled environment.
